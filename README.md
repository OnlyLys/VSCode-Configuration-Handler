# README

This repository contains utility classes to help my extensions get typechecked configuration values.

# Testing

There are two ways to perform tests:
 1. Open the project in VS Code. Then run the `Run Tests` debug launch option.
 1. Run `npm test` in the command line. This will automatically download VS Code and run the tests.

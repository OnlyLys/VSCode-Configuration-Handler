# README

This repository contains utility classes to manipulate configurations of VS Code extensions. 

This is primarily a shared dependency for VS Code extensions that I am working on. As such, documentation will be sparse.

# Testing

There are two ways to perform testing:
 1. Open the project in VS Code. Then run the `Run Tests` debug launch option.
 1. Run `npm test` in the command line. This will automatically download VS Code and run the tests.
